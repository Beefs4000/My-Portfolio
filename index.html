            <p class="main-text">I worked in the steel industry for 10 years and previously the construction and
                manufacturing industries. I have found the work both challenging and rewarding. I am always looking to
                improve my knowledge and experience, either through hand-on work or study. I get the most enjoyment when
                I can help develop innovations, streamline work practices and foster a collaborative and healthy
                environment for my team to work in. As a former head of department, I believe the best leadership
                practice is to establish a vision of what we want to achieve and curate a culture that trusts the team
                to work and accomplish the tasks given while also encouraging them to operate autonomously. </p>

                This is the first project I worked on during my bootcamp cause. In this project I learned the value of
                using the correct semantic language in HTML. Having to correct this coded from generic /div/ elements
                to a readable structure, helped me better understand the flow. It also showed me how the effective use
                of class and ID can be to simplify a style.css file. During this project I was able to flex my google
                search
                muscles and find many valuable resources regarding how semantic language should be approached, not just
                as
                best practice but also when considering the need of user, depending on how they are access your website.

                This is the first group project I worked on. We worked out the idea and wireframe quite quickly. We
                settled on making a random videogame selector, we would ask a series of questions to the user, once we had
                narrowed the critera down, we would generate a random game for the user to play. It was over 2 weeks and this was
                truly challenging. As a team of three we split the work into the landing, options and results pages. The
                biggest take away I had from this project was communicating effectivly. We had issues getting together
                in the first week, this lead to streamlining the the functionality of the website to meet the timeframe.

                In this project we tasked ourselves with making a simple ecommerce website to display local artist work.
                Where users can log in, browse through various artists and styles on display, select their favorite
                pieces, add them to a cart, then check out if desired. We used Node.js and Express.js to create RESTful
                API's. Our template engine was Handlebars with some boostrapping for the UI. To store the data we used
                MySQL and Sequelize. For basic authentication we used express-session.

                For this project I decided to make a social media posting site. It has has a backend and a front end. 
                    It grants users the ability to add, remove, like, and update various posts. 
                    I used MongoDB, Express, Node, React, GraphQL, and Node. With this implementation I used a 
                    GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and 
                    persist data to a social media app back-end. This was a very difficult project and it required 
                    hours and hours of tutorials for me to complete. Aside from the general difficulty of creating 
                    the app, maintaining syntax and naming conventions across the all the files was a painful and 
                    caused a lot of debugging.
